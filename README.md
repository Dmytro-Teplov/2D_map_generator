## 2D_map_generator
Welcome to my bachelor's diploma project: a 2D map creator application. 
This application streamlines the process of crafting final maps or brainstorming map ideas by utilizing Perlin noise for terrain heightmap generation. 
With this tool, you can paint entities such as terrain, water or assets, and the application will enhance the landscape realism while allowing to quickly distribute assets.

# How to use it
In order to run the application you can use executable in the Diploma_project directory, it should work.
In the Diploma_project directory you can find linux executable, which is also supposed to work out of the box.
You can also compile your own executable since in this repository you can find Visual Studio project file and linux compilation command for g++.
