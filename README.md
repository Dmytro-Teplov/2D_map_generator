# 2D_map_generator
In order to run the map generator you can launch Diploma_Project.sln in the visual studio and press run.
Theoretically it should work, since all the additional libraries are attached with relative paths and already present if you pull whole project.
In the Diploma_project directory you canfind linux executable, which is also supposed to work out of the box.
